# web-dev-starter

This is a practice assignment for understanding layouts in CSS. In this case, I went with the flexbox as my resolution for the given tasks.

## Getting Started / Running

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

To run this code, simply download the repo to your machine and then access it via VS Code and use Live Preview or find the html file and run it within your local browser.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

There are no tests to run within this project. However, you can stretch the web browser or Preview screen to test the cohesion of the content within the webpage, given varying sizes.
